Proposed Unique Features for the HRM Project
AI-Enhanced Candidate Matching
 
 	
The AI-Enhanced Candidate Matching feature utilizes artificial intelligence algorithms to improve the efficiency and accuracy of the candidate selection process in Human Resource Management. Inspired by the research on the use of AI in HR processes, this feature aims to streamline the recruitment process by automatically matching candidate profiles with job requirements.

tables to be inputed: candidates profile, job requirement, matched candidate
libraries:  mostly python libraries nltk, matplotlib, tensorflow(if neccessary), and api libraries


Creating a complete AI-Enhanced Candidate Matching feature with a user interface (UI) involves several components, including backend logic, frontend design, and integration with the specified libraries. Below is a simplified example using Python and some common libraries for AI and UI development.
# Import necessary libraries
import nltk
from nltk.tokenize import word_tokenize
from nltk.corpus import stopwords
from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import CountVectorizer
from sklearn.metrics.pairwise import cosine_similarity

# Sample data (you can replace this with your database connectivity)
candidates_profile = {"candidate_1": "Experienced software engineer with expertise in Python and Java.",
                     "candidate_2": "Entry-level data analyst skilled in data visualization using Matplotlib.",
                     # Add more candidate profiles
                    }
                    
note: this is just a draft 

job_requirement = "Looking for a software engineer proficient in Python and Java."
Backend (Python Script):
# Preprocessing functions
def preprocess(text):
    stop_words = set(stopwords.words('english'))
    words = word_tokenize(text)
    words = [word.lower() for word in words if word.isalnum() and word.lower() not in stop_words]
    return ' '.join(words)

# Vectorization function
def vectorize_text(text):
    vectorizer = CountVectorizer().fit_transform([text, job_requirement])
    vectors = vectorizer.toarray()
    return vectors[0], vectors[1]

# Candidate matching function
def match_candidates(candidate_profiles):
    matches = {}
    job_requirement_vector, _ = vectorize_text(preprocess(job_requirement))

    for candidate, profile in candidate_profiles.items():
        candidate_vector, _ = vectorize_text(preprocess(profile))
        similarity_score = cosine_similarity([job_requirement_vector], [candidate_vector])[0][0]
        matches[candidate] = similarity_score

    # Sort candidates by similarity score
    sorted_matches = sorted(matches.items(), key=lambda x: x[1], reverse=True)
    return sorted_matches

# Sample output
matched_candidates = match_candidates(candidates_profile)
print("Matched Candidates:")
for candidate, score in matched_candidates:
    print(f"{candidate}: {score}")
